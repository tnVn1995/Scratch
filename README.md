# Implementing Popular Machine Learning Models from Scratch

I'll be implement ML models from scratch and apply them on the Boston dataset for regression and iris dataset for classification

## Models

1. LR.py: Linear Regression model

## Usage

- Clone the repo in your local directory 
- Move to the directory that contains the repo
- Install the required environment using these codes on the command line:

> conda env create -f environment.yml

- Once isntalled, activate the environment:

> conda activate pythonwdask

- Then run any model in the command line with:

> python LR.py
